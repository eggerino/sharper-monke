> Implementation of the Monkey Programming Language in C#

This is my take on implementing the Monkey Programming Language in C# as discribed in [the interpreter book](https://interpreterbook.com/) and the [the compiler book](https://compilerbook.com/) by [Thorsten Ball](https://thorstenball.com/).

# Usage

Build the project

```
dotnet build
```

Run the tests

```
dotnet test
```

Run the intepreter

```
dotnet run --project src/Monkey.Interpreter <FILEPATH>
```

Run the repl

```
dotnet run --project src/Monkey.Interpreter
```
